        <p class="text">Marcus Chen thought he was just testing quantum entanglement protocols in his family's basement when his homemade quantum computer began displaying impossible readings. What started as a routine experiment with particle pairs in 2087 quickly became something far more significant when Chen realized he had accidentally created a stable temporal displacement field. The seventeen-year-old's quantum setup, assembled from readily available consumer-grade components, had somehow tapped into the fundamental mechanics of time itself.</p>
        <p class="text">Chen's initial excitement turned to concern when he discovered that each temporal displacement event left distinct quantum signatures that could be detected and tracked across vast distances. Recognizing the profound implications for both scientific advancement and global security, Chen approached federal authorities with his findings rather than attempting to exploit the discovery. His detailed documentation of the process and its detectable aftereffects became the foundation for what would eventually become the Time Bureau, a new federal agency tasked with monitoring and regulating temporal research. Chen now serves as the agency's youngest scientific advisor, helping to develop protocols that ensure time travel technology remains both scientifically valuable and safely controlled.</p>
