# freeCodeCamp Full-Stack Web Development Course

This repository consists of the lab works and capstone projects for the "Full-Stack Web Development Certification" from [freeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org).

- The course is currently in beta (at leats at time of beginning the course, and writing this README), and it credited users for lessons already done from other course work.
- That said, this picks up after much of the CSS portion of the course.
- Updating this README as well as actually organizing the repo will be a work in progress as I continue with the work.
